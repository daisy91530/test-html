						upload the rest of our homeworks onto this website,<br>
						and try to learn coding at the same time.

					<p>I really enjoy this course. <i class="fa fa-heart-o"></i></p>

					<p>Name : 朱蝶 Daisy (Computer Science Junior)</p>
					<p>Student ID : 0516322</p>
					<p><strong>Hi I'm Daisy. </strong>I am a member of the PR group in the Student Association of Computer Science and I learn to communicate with different types of people. I also took a course about entrepreneurship. Being the leader of my group, I show strong leadership skill and great team spirit. These positions make me good at communication effectively and being initiative and independent. As for my hobbies, I like to play basketball and flute to relax myself, so I am good at alleviate stress and pressure while studying.</p>
					<p>I see myself as a mature, self-motivated and reliable person with excellent health and pleasant personality. My goal is to broaden my horizons by working with different people and learning new things. I believe that success is a journey, not a destination, therefore, I am always ready to absorb new knowledge.</p>
